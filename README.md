A comprehensive Early Childhood Development (ECD) management platform designed to streamline child registration, developmental screening, and administrative oversight for state-wide programs.

## 🌟 Overview

The Jiveesha ECD Platform empowers Anganwadi Workers (AWW), supervisors, and state officials with real-time data to monitor and improve child development outcomes. It bridges the gap between ground-level screening and administrative decision-making through a robust, scalable digital infrastructure.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 👥 User & Role Management
- **Hierarchical RBAC**: Fine-grained permissions for AWWs, Screeners, CDPOs, DPOs, and Admins.
- **Bulk Operations**: High-speed CSV imports, batch assignments to geographic units, and system-wide bulk actions.
- **Dynamic Role Mapping**: Real-time permission updates across the interface based on role definitions.

### 📍 Geographic Hierarchy
- **Structured Mapping**: Management of Districts, Mandals (Projects), and Anganwadi Centers (AWC).
- **Auto-Cascading Selectors**: Intelligent filtering of geographic units across the platform.

### 📋 Screening & Tracking
- **Child Registration**: Comprehensive profiles for children and caregivers.
- **Developmental Screening**: Support for AI-driven protocols and standard questionnaires.
- **Risk Scoring**: Automated risk assessment based on screening results.

### 🔐 Security & Oversight
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive tracking of all administrative actions for transparency.
- **Supabase Integration**: Secure authentication and Row-Level Security (RLS) for data protection.
- **Server Actions**: Secure, server-side data mutations with built-in validation.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
